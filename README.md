# FinalProject-distributed

This repository contains a distributed system composed of multiple microservices, organized by business domains.

Each service is built with different backend technologies (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#) and databases (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).  
The system includes authentication, inventory, scheduling, notifications, and learning tools for musical collaboration.

This `main` branch has been cleaned up to serve as a clean base.  
The development is being carried out in the `test` branch.
